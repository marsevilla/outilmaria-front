## Local Development

### With Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build

```

App will run at: http://localhost:4200

### Manual Setup 
```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

### Environment Config 

Edit the file:
src/environments/environment.ts

```bash
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000',
};
```

### Testing 
```bash
ng test
```


### Code Quality (Planned)
- Linter : eslint
- Formatters : prettier

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Git & Commits 
Branches : 
- main : production-ready
- develop : in-progress features
- feat/*, fix/*

Commit Convention :  
Use Conventional Commits:
```bash
feat(form): add budget field
fix(ui): fix column alignment in table
```

### License
MIT or internal (to confirm)

```bash

You're now ready to:
 Commit those to GitHub  
 Use them as base for onboarding, CI, Docker, tests


### Next Step?
Would you like me to now:
- **Generate your backend folder structure (`app/api`, `models`, etc.)** with stubs you can start filling?
- Or move on to **tooling (black, flake8, eslint, prettier, pytest setup)**?
You decide whatâ€™s next!
